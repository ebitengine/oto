## Platforms

* Windows
* macOS
* Linux
* FreeBSD
* OpenBSD
* Android
* iOS
* Web browsers ([GopherJS](https://github.com/gopherjs/gopherjs) and WebAssembly)

## Prerequisite

### macOS

Oto requies `AudioToolbox.framework`, but this is automatically linked.

### iOS

Oto requies these frameworks:

* `AVFoundation.framework`
* `AudioToolbox.framework`

Add them to "Linked Frameworks and Libraries" on your Xcode project.

### Linux

libasound2-dev is required. On Ubuntu or Debian, run this command:

```sh
apt install libasound2-dev
```

In most cases this command must be run by root user or through `sudo` command.

#### Crosscompiling

To crosscompile, make sure the libraries for the target architecture are installed, and set `CGO_ENABLED=1` as Go disables [Cgo](https://golang.org/cmd/cgo/#hdr-Using_cgo_with_the_go_command) on crosscompiles by default

### FreeBSD

OpenAL is required. Install openal-soft:

```sh
pkg install openal-soft
```

### OpenBSD

```sh
pkg_add -r openal
```
